# country-fact-project

This is just a basic readme file I will update as soon as I commit my Latest changes.

## Intro

I am currently reading Pure React by Dave and it's a wonderful book. This is in addition to taking the 8hrs Net Ninja's React Crash course. These two resources are very good, but something wasn't complete. I felt that I needed to build something. Something from scratch utilizing all I had learned. State, props, hooks, propTypes, e.t.c

With that, I proceeded to check frontendmentor. Took one challenge and went to work.

The site below is a responsive web app. It shows you information about countries around the world. You can search for a specific country and then filter by continent.
There is also a dark theme toggle if you prefer dark themes -- this was really fun to make.

Check it out below hosted through Netlify.
